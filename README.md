K-means Clustering Project

1. Introduction to the Topic
1.1 History and Background
Parallel computing has transformed data processing by enabling the execution of tasks concurrently across multiple cores or processors. This allows for the efficient handling of large datasets and complex algorithms.
The K-means clustering algorithm, introduced by Stuart Lloyd in 1957, is a foundational technique in unsupervised learning. Initially applied in pulse-code modulation, it is now widely used across various fields due to its ability to partition data into meaningful clusters.
1.2 K-means Algorithm
K-means is an algorithm that divides data into 
ùëò
k clusters, assigning each data point to the nearest centroid based on distance.
How K-means Works:
Initialization: Choose 
ùëò
k random centroids from the dataset.
Assignment: Assign each data point to the closest centroid.
Update: Recalculate centroids by averaging the points in each cluster.
Repeat: Continue the assignment and update steps until the centroids stabilize or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
